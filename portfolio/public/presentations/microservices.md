# Microservices Architecture
## Best Practices

---

## What are Microservices?

- Small, autonomous services
- Independently deployable
- Single responsibility principle
- Technology agnostic

---

## Key Benefits

- **Scalability**: Scale services independently
- **Flexibility**: Use different technologies
- **Resilience**: Fault isolation
- **Team Autonomy**: Independent development

---

## Architecture Patterns

### API Gateway
- Single entry point
- Request routing
- Authentication
- Rate limiting

---

## Service Communication

### Synchronous
- REST APIs
- GraphQL
- gRPC

### Asynchronous
- Message queues
- Event streaming
- Pub/Sub

---

## Data Management

- Database per service
- Event sourcing
- CQRS pattern
- Saga pattern

---

## Deployment Strategies

### Container Orchestration
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Service mesh

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated testing
- Blue-green deployment
- Canary releases

---

## Monitoring & Observability

- Distributed tracing
- Centralized logging
- Metrics collection
- Health checks

---

## Best Practices

1. Design for failure
2. Implement circuit breakers
3. Use service discovery
4. Version your APIs
5. Implement proper security

---

## Challenges

- Increased complexity
- Network latency
- Data consistency
- Testing difficulties
