            ## Pin GitHub Actions
            
            This PR pins GitHub Actions to their full commit SHA for improved security.
            
            ### Why pin actions?
            - Prevents supply chain attacks from compromised action tags
            - Ensures reproducible builds
            - Protects against malicious updates
            
            ### Notes
            - Dependabot will still create PRs to update these pinned versions
            - Review each update carefully before merging
